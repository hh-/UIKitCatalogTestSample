Using Cocoapods to obtain the EarlGrey test framework

To run these tests locally:
1.  Clone the repository
2.  Install the EarlGrey framework
3.  This can be done with 'brew install cocoapods'
4.  Homebrew can be installed per instructions here:  https://brew.sh/
5.  After installing the EarlGrey framework, open the "UIKitCatalog.xcworkspace" (not the 'UIKitCatalog.xcodeproj' project file) to open the project workspace and run the tests
